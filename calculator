         *** Primary Sitting ***

1:First, we display some primary information about the calculator:
	
System.out.println("---------------------------------- \n" +
  "Welcome to Basic Calculator \n" +
  "----------------------------------");
System.out.println("Following operations are supported : \n" +
  "1. Addition (+) \n" +
  "2. Subtraction (-) \n" +
  "3. Multiplication (*) \n" +
  "4. Division (/) \n");

2:Then we use java.util.Scanner to capture user input:

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
 
System.out.println("Enter an operator: (+ OR - OR * OR /) ");
char operation = scanner.next().charAt(0);
 
System.out.println("Enter the first number: ");
double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();
 
System.out.println("Enter the second number: ");
double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();

3:When we give inputs to the system, we must first validate them. 
For example, if the entry is not one of +, -, Ã— or /, our calculator will show an incorrect entry. 
Similarly, if we enter the second number to divide by 0, it will give a good result. 
So we implement validations. 
First, on the position where the operator is invalid:

if (!(operation == '+' || operation == '-' || operation == '*' || operation == '/')) {
    System.err.println("Invalid Operator. Please use only + or - or * or /");
}
